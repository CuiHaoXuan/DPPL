This repository contains the matlab scripts of DPPL proposed in the paper "Machine Learning meets Stochastic Geometry:
Determinantal Subset Selection for Wireless
Networks". 

Run "TrainDPP.m" to generate the results.
Under the folder "GenerateTrainingSet", use generateTrainingSet.m to generate new training sets.
